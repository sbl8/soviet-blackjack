[Blackjack – Soviet Edition](https://sbl8.github.io/soviet-blackjack/) is a browser game that brings classic blackjack action with a distinct Soviet-era aesthetic. Why did I do this? I don't know man, I don't know, but here it is lol.

## How to Play

- **Deal (D):** Start a round by placing a bet.
- **Hit (H):** Request an additional card.
- **Stand (S):** End your turn and let the dealer play.
- **Restart (R):** Reset the game.
- **Share Score (C):** Once your high score exceeds $1000, generate a shareable score card.

## Design & Architecture

- **Tech:** Built with React (via CDN), vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.
- **UI:** Animated card transitions, a canvas‑generated Soviet‑inspired score card, and a container styled with a dark wood–inspired texture.
